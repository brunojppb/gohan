## Features

This is a learning project of mine that I aim to use to generate my own websites. I am going to slowly work on the following features:

- Markdown Lexer and Parser
- Markdown to HTML compiler
- Web app compiled to WebAssembly to demo the parser/compiler
- Syntax highlighting for the most common languages I use
- Support for templating
